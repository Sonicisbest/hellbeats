:dad:Well would you look at that, I think you've actually improved since the last time I heard you sing.
:bf:Bap!
:dad:Great!
:dad:*Pico grabs Bf's arm tightly and drops his smile*
:dad:Now let's go.
:bf:Baboop!
:gf:Let him go!
:gf:I want to know exactly who you are and I wanna know what you're so upset about!
:dad:Ugh. Listen princess, I don’t have to tell you anything! Just let me do my job.
:gf:This ‘job’ of yours involves stealing my lover away from me, so no! I can’t just let you take him!
:dad:You don’t get it, I can’t just go back with nothing! Like I said, this isn’t a choice, not even for me.
:gf:There’s always a choice. Let him go and we’ll figure something out.
:bf:Skidep..? Bop bee.
:dad:Really, again!? Fine.
