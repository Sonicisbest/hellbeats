:gf:Mmm…
:bf:Boop?
:gf:Huh? Oh, I’m fine babe.
:gf:I just… can’t take my stupid parents anymore.
:gf:I’ve just wanted to spend some time with you, at least for a minute, 
:gf:but of course they have to ruin it all…
:bf:Skideep boo bap...
:gf:I’m terribly sorry for dragging you into my mess Boyfriend, I ain’t really the brightest girlfriend out there, huh?
:bf:Beep! Bop bo skee dop! Bo bap bee, beep!
:gf:Aw thank you baby...I love you too.
:???: *laugh* Did you really think you could get away with this, Bf…?
:bf:Beep?!
:gf:Wha- who are you?!
:???:Why don't you ask him, lady.
:gf:...Boyfriend..?
:bf:???
:dad:It’s me, you dolt.
:bf:Beep bo?!
:dad:Good to see the disguise works..
:dad:Anyway, Boyfriend, you have been ordered to return to the gates of Heaven immediately.
:dad:You know that an angel in hell for so long is strictly forbidden, we don't want a repeat of last time now do we?
:bf:Bop...
:dad:Exactly! So come on, let's go before this situation gets any worse for you.
:bf:*shakes head* Bo! Beep beep ski doo.
:dad:Don't be like that man, make this easier for the both of us, please? It’ll be a lot less painless if you return willingly.
:gf:Painless?! You are not going to be hurting us no matter what happens!
:gf:I don't know who you are exactly, but Boyfriend isn't going anywhere with you.
:dad:...
:dad:Tch, that's cute. Your girl is sticking up for you, Bf.
:bf:B-Beep!
:dad:Unfortunately for you though, this isn't a choice. I'm not here to play around, I just want to get my job done, and go home. Give up, you have no other options.
:bf:Hm...Bee bap!
:dad:Winning a rap battle won't get you out of this!
:bf:Boop!
:dad:you still can't take anything seriously, huh?
:dad:Fine, I'll do your little song fight. After this though, it's curtains. Remember, you have no choice.
