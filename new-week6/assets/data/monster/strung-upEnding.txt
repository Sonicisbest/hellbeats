:pump:*Skid and Pump stare at their feet, and there’s a sudden feeling of despair in the air*
:bf:Boo bep…
:gf:...What happened to you two?
:pump:*Pump looks to the side, refusing to talk*
:skid:You’re not allowed to know.
:bf:Beep?
:skid:...Fine. Me and Pump used to love Halloween, but we called it Spooky Month.
:pump:It was dumb.
:skid:And we used to make friends with demons like you, because we thought it was fun!
:pump:One day we met a mean one, and it pulled us all the way down here.
:bf&gf: *Bf and Gf cringe at the mental image of two young children being dragged to hell.*
:skid:We tried to escape to go to heaven instead, but…
:pump:When we got there they said it was too late, and they forced us back down.
:skid:They threatened us with their swords and everything!
:bf:Badoop!?
:pump:It was our fault for messing with demon stuff.
:skid:Pump, don’t say that…
:pump:It’s true though!
:skid:...
:skid:*Skid doesn’t seem to able to prove him wrong on that*
:bf:Beep bop bappeebo?
:skid:They won’t give us another chance.
:pump:Not after today.
:gf:Well you never know, right?
:skid:No. We’ve talked to so many others.
:pump:They all say we’re hopeless, and they’re right.
:pump:We’re never leaving…
:bf:Beep pee p-
:skid:Being kind to us won’t make a difference!
:skid:*Both Skid and Pump are on the brink of crying once again*
:gf:Boys-
:skid:Stop!
:pump:We want to believe you but…
:pump:We just… can’t.
:pump:*Skid and Pump run away in tears, leaving Bf and Gf alone once more*
:bf:Beep. Badoop bap skidee bop. Beeskep boop.
:gf:It would never hurt to try, babe. Maybe one day.
